# Caffeine-cooled hacking station

Hello there! Im **Coffee** and this is my personal blog and portfolio. Here you can find pieces of my research and work. Dont hesitate to provide feedback under the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CoffeeNData/coffeendata.github.io).

## Technical specifications

Im quite polivalent. I do web pentesting, infrastructure pentesting, OSINT, development and reverse engineering for fun and profit! Im always open to finding and _hacking_ through new tech.

## M2 NVMe mindset

I know how to code in a variety of languages, including Python, C, PowerShell, Bash and a bit of C++. Though, I know well how to read the vast majority of other languages.

## Persistent as an HDD

Ive done a couple of (_really challenging but ethical_) projects through the years. From malware reverse engineering and analysis to a full-size Domain Administrator takeover on labs!

## Sixteen-core time efficiency

My days have 384 hours. Thanks to the multi-core brain in my motherboard Im able to achieve a mind-blowing quantity of tasks through my day, with just enough time for a cup (_or many more_) of coffee.

## A thousand kWh power supply

Through focus, caffeine and a rock solid will power I never run out energy! I am always open to help, participate and research.

## Half human half machine

At the end of the day, we all have a heart inside (_at least most of us_). I also enjoy my sweet bedtime and my social life, Im more human than I look!
